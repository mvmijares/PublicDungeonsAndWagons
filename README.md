# DungeonsAndWagons

Contains code and other assets for the game project I am working on together with a team. The game is written in C# using the Unity Engine and is currently being developed for the PC platform. The code contains a mixture of game mechanics, user interfaces, artificial intelligence and more.

The files included in the repository include :

1. GameManager.cs - A C# script which handles initialization order, scene management in Unity, and contains references to other classes.
2. Level.cs - A C# script which is the base class for different levels in our game. Derived classes contain logic for each level.
3. Character.cs - A C# script which is the base class for characters within the game.
4. InputHandler.cs - A C# script which links input commands with event calls.
5. Item.cs - A C# script which defines the base class for items within the game.
6. Inventory.cs - A C# script which defines the base class for inventories witin the game.
